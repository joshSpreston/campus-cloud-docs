About UCSB Campus Cloud

Cloud computing, also known as the public cloud, the commercial cloud, or just “the cloud,” is a massive computing resource accessed via the internet. 
Cloud computing has five major components:

  * Compute: Virtual machines ranging from small to extremely powerful
  * Storage: Effectively infinite
  * Networking: Connectivity both local and with the internet
  * Data management: Databases and related structure
  * Services: Special features such as streaming data analytics

Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google are among the largest Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). 
They offer their computers, storage and networking hardware as a service, through the web, known as “Infrastructure as a Service” (IaaS). 
They also provide higher-level “Platform as a Service” (PaaS) on top of those basic services, such as data management and networking tools that range from operating systems to databases and many more add-on services. 
All these resources are maintained in secure data centers in multiple geographic locations. Customers access resources online, buying as little or as much as they need.

The UC Santa Barbara Campus Cloud Team works closely with public cloud vendors to provide the campus with cost-effective cloud access, while allowing federal compliance regulations (HIPAA, FISMA, FERPA, PCI, FedRAMP, etc). 
Read below for more information on the benefits of cloud computing for research, including cost, security, usability and scale. 
The current focus is heavily on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a primary Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for simplicity, ease of use, and cost savings.
