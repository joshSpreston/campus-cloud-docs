##AWS Service Catalog

The AWS Service Catalog enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of products that are approved for use on AWS. The Campus Cloud Team and or the local Admininstrator of an Account may create a Service Catalog. One create in the account is scoped to that account only.  A Service CAtalog from the Campus Cloud Team is meant to provide features (or services) that you can add to your account by choosing them from a menu. It is also possible for Account holders to submit services they have created for use in the campus Service Catalog.
