Getting Started

The UCSB Campus Cloud allows faculty, researchers and staff to provision and use computing resources from approved vendors that have agreements in place with the University of California.

For public cloud hosting, an approved provider is Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Using an approved provider means that:

  * You have access to account management and solution architects — AWS staff who can assist with how to use AWS, and provide technical guidance on best practices.
  * Your vendor relationship falls under the University of California Terms & Conditions. This ensures that your agreement conforms to the UC Regents’ policies for procurement and business contracts, and reduces the financial risk to your department or division for agreements that are outside of Regental standing orders (especially with respect to third-party liability).
  

## Procure an AWS Account

Follow the instructions below to ensure that an AWS account for UCSB business is covered under this agreement and in compliance with UC policy and the law.

You will only be able to access the AWS services after all steps below are completed and ITS Cloud Services receives approval and confirmation from AWS.

  1. Log in to the UCSB Gateway Procurement System
  2. Complete the Campus Cloud Form. Provide the requested information.
  3. Add the completed for to your Cart and submit your requisition.
  4. The Campus Cloud team will receive your Purchase Order and contact you to schedule a meeting finalizing your account. 
  5. After this meeting you will receive an activation email from AWS:
     * Confirming that the account is set up for invoicing under the UC AWS agreement, and
     * Providing final instructions to activate your account
  6. Assign users to your Account Groups.
  7. Your account will be billed through the Master Payer Account with consolidated billing. Any monthly costs will be charged against the Purchase Order you submitted.
